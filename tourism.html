<h2>Space Tourism</h2>
<p>Space tourism is when normal people pay to go to space just to see it. Virgin Galactic has announced that it will start taking paying customers to space in 2021. As of now the cost to go to space with Virgin Galactic is $250,000 for a 90 minute ride. There are already people on their waiting list like Justin Bieber and Leonardo DiCaprio.</p>
